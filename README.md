# density-current
Density currents are formed due to the density difference between two fluids or between the layers of a fluid
The density difference will lead to creation of density currents. In this study, experiments have done with 28 different modes with varying discharge, concentration and bed slope. The results showed significant relation between the increase of the distance from the source of the density current and the thickening of the turbidity current, Moreover, the entrainment term increased between intersection density current and water. Due to the continuous local constriction of the channel, the velocity rate of density current increased and the thickness of density current decreased. Likewise, the general relationship can be applied with the instability of entrainment surface and current hydraulic parameters considering all experiments' modes
